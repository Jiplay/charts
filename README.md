# Saving Vision

This project is my first experience with Vite.js & Victory (the package for the charts). I did a dashboard to visualize the division of an income, to save money to specific project and have basics precision.

I used Bootstrap as well for components & layout.

I had fun working on this project, I might want to do a more precise version in the future
